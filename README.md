# üìù Notes Web Application

The **Notes Web Application** is a simple yet powerful tool that enables users to securely manage their personal notes online. Built with Python, Flask, HTML, and light JavaScript, the application provides essential functionality for note-taking with user authentication to ensure data privacy. Each user has a unique account where they can create, view, and delete notes, which are securely stored in a backend database using SQLAlchemy.

This project demonstrates the core concepts of web development, including user authentication, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and database integration. It's an ideal foundation for expanding into more complex applications, such as task management systems, journaling apps, or other productivity tools. 

## üåü Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can securely sign up, log in, and log out, ensuring that notes are only accessible by the authenticated user.
- **Note Management**: Users can create, view, and delete notes within their personal dashboard, providing a streamlined interface for note-taking.
- **Database Integration**: Notes are stored in a database using SQLAlchemy, with each note linked to the user account via a foreign key relationship, ensuring efficient and secure data management.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a responsive front-end design using HTML and light JavaScript to ensure accessibility across various devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: For backend logic and managing the application flow.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for routing, handling requests, and user authentication.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database integration, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of user data.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For creating the front-end interface, providing a simple and responsive user experience.
